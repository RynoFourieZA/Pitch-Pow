To contribute to the repository, ensure that you follow the following guidelines:

1. Develop on any branch besides the ``master`` branch. @bradley-mubenga will ensure that there is a new branch for every objective we plan to accomplish.

2. Once you have completed your developing on the branch, make a pull request to the ``master`` branch. Once peers have reviewed the code and @RynoFourieZA checks that the code meets our naming conventions @bradley-mubenga will merge to the main branch. **Do not merge any branch to the main branch without the team's approval**

6. An emergency meeting is called on a friday if things are not working at all or if we have a serious problem.
